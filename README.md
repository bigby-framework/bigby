## Summary

üöß **WARNING: UNDER CONSTRUCTION!** üöß

**Bigby is a JavaScript/TypeScript framework for the rapid development of HTML5
games.** It is currently under heavy development, which is why I'm humbly asking
you to not take anything you're seeing here too seriously, as the whole project
is going to remain very much in flux for a little while longer. If you want to
follow development, please follow [@hmans](https://twitter.com/hmans) and/or
[@BigbyFramework](https://twitter.com/bigbyframework) on Twitter. Thanks!

## Structure of this repository

Bigby is split into a collection of packages that are all developed in sync as part of this monorepo:

- **@bigby/core**: just the core classes, no game-specific functionality.
- **@bigby/game**: the core game engine (2D rendering, sprites, shaders, ...)
- **@bigby/physics2d**: 2D physics

## Contributing

**üöß Reminder: Bigby is currently under heavy construction.** If you want to contribute, please get in touch first before you start work on your PR. Bigby is moving very fast at the moment, and chances for getting unannounced PRs merged are relatively low.

To get started, clone the repository, and run the following commands:

```
yarn install  # installs all dependencies
yarn build    # performs an initial build of all packages
yarn dev      # fires up dev/watch mode for everything
```
