## Summary

🚧 **WARNING: UNDER CONSTRUCTION!** 🚧

**Bigby is a JavaScript/TypeScript framework for the rapid development of HTML5
games.** It is currently under heavy development, which is why I'm humbly asking
you to not take anything you're seeing here too seriously, as the whole project
is going to remain very much in flux for a little while longer. If you want to
follow development, please follow [@hmans](https://twitter.com/hmans) and/or
[@BigbyFramework](https://twitter.com/bigbyframework) on Twitter. Thanks!

## Contributing

Bigby is split into various small-ish packages, all of which are developed in sync within a Lerna-powered monorepo. To get started, clone the repository, and run the following commands:

```
yarn install    # installs all dependencies
yarn build:all  # performs an initial build of all packages
yarn dev        # fires up dev/watch mode for everything
```
